			Raised on a little island in the middle of the sea called Maui. I spent my time frolicking in the ocean living a pirate's life. I started to feel like something was missing, I couldn't figure it out right away but I knew it was because I wanted to be more then a pirate. I had dreams and projects I wanted to accomplish, but I didn't have the skills I needed to do so. I decided to enroll in a Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. I hopped, skipped and jumped away over to a larger island called Australia to fill the void I was feeling and begin the journey of becomming a Web Developer.

			It was not an easy Journey. Their were moments where I doubted my decision to come to a far away land and not be a pirate anymore. I missed the sun, wind and waves, and commandeering ships full of rum, but I pushed through and persevered. I got to manifest my ideas into reality something I didn't ever know if I would accomplish. I did it and I finished.
	 </p>

	  <p>
			Now I've graduated and I'm sent off into the real world. I spend my time now building projects, learning new technoligies, and trying to make the world a better place. I have always had a passion for building things, for knowledge and for helping people.
